Spencer's Code folder is only the source code from what I'm assuming was exported
	from an IDE.

Analysis is my conclusions and charts.

Sorting is my original, unobscured code with commments.

CrimeSort is what I sent to Spencer - an obfuscated version of Sorting.

Spencer's Output is the output sample that I used for my analysis.
